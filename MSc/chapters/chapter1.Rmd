# Chapter One\label{chap:first}

This is a chapter which can contain subsections, subsubsections, subsubsubsections, as well as LaTeX hidden subsections or whatever else you want. 

In here you can also cite authors from your bibtex using RefManageR like so `r Cite(bib, "Engelbrecht2002")`. There are lots of ways to cite with RefManageR you can find out more information on this by pulling up the help files for the packages in RStudio with ``?Cite``.

In paragraphs you can draw emphasis to certain words with *italic*, **bold**, _italic_, or __bold__.


## Basic Markdown Features

This is a subsection. In a subsection you can include many things including lists, equations (referenced), output from blocks of R code, R plots, etc.

This is a list ...

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b

this is a block quote ...

> Let's get schwifty

and this is a horizontal rule ...

------

and this is a LaTeX equations ...

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-abc}
a + b = c
\end{equation}

which can be referenced in line \autoref{eq-abc}.

Equations can also be done inline without referencing $e = mc^2$

### Running inline R Code

R code outputs can be integrated directly into your dissertation.

This can be done inline e.g. the iris dataset has `r nrow(iris)` rows and `r ncol(iris)` columns.

Or we can run the R code as a chunk and just include text outputs ...

```{r}
print(summary(iris))
```

or plot outputs (with captions, labels, and sizes) ... 

```{r fig.cap = "A caption. \\label{irisgraph}", fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
plot(iris)
```

#### Subsubsubsection

We can also include \LaTeX components such as tables ...

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{This is a table with info}
\label{table-paramvalues}
\begin{tabular}{ p{4cm} p{4cm} p{4cm} }
\hline \\ [-1.5ex]
colname & colname & colname \\ [1ex]
\hline \\ [-1.5ex]
Info & info & info \\ [1ex]
Info & info & info \\ [1ex]
Info & info & info \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We can also include figures into the document ...
